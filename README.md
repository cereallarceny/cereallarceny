## Hi there, I'm Patrick ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ¦„ **I'm a jack of all trades, master of a few**<br />I'm a fraction CTO, software engineer, and UI designer working remotely in Nashville, Tennessee. I've been coding professionally for over 17 years and leading tech teams and engineering orgs (80+ people) for the last 7 years. I prefer Next.js and Typescript for application development, but can work with just about any stack.
- ðŸ’° **I'm entrepreneurial and cannot manage sit still**<br />I'm the CTO of [Raise Financial](https://raisefinancial.com), a financial services startup empowering everyday Americans to save smarter for college, retirement, and beyond. In my free-time I build active trading systems based on technical and fundamental analysis.
- ðŸ’» **I'm passionate about open-source software**<br />I served as the Federated Learning and Engineering Team Leads for [OpenMined](https://openmined.org) for a number of years, and was one of the original founding members of the community. I'm passionate about the power of open-source software and projects that on the bleeding edge of research in the fields of privacy and data ownership. If you're interested in that as well, drop me a message!
